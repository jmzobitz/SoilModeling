Processing pipeline for package data

1) Read in raw data files from data-raw using data-prepare.R
2) Analyze temperature sensitivity of Q10 to enzymes with enzyme-analysis.R
- need to put this not in the R package directory, include this in the build ignore

Running to do list:
- get documentation set up for:
  * flux_data
  * microbe_data
  * Q10_temperature
  * mcmc_defaults
