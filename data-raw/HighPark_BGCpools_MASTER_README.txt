Date refers to date soil collected
all soils extracted within 24 hours
(fumigation/extraction technique)

Approximately 100 g of soil from the organic rich mineral layer (3-12 cm in depth) was collected from a random location within the plot and stored on ice until processed. Soils were separated into three sets of samples to characterize (1) a suite of biogeochemical analysis including microbial C and N, DOC, DON, DIN, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus, (2) microbial exo-enzyme activity and (3) organic compound composition.
Within twelve hours, we sieved and homogenized soils, removing coarse plant litter, debris, and larger (>1 mm) roots. Soil samples were then immediately extracted for DOC, DON, DIN, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus following the procedures of Weintraub et al. (2007).  The extraction solution, 0.5M K2SO4, collects nutrients, from the labile, non-occluded soil pools. This includes readily soluble and desorbable P, primarily in the form of orthophosphate. Such phosphate is quickly cycled and readily available for plant uptake, but does not represent all potential available plant P, especially over time. Briefly, 25 mL of 0.5 M potassium sulfate (K2SO4) was added to 5 g of homogenized sample, agitated on an orbital shaker for one hour at 120 rpm and then vacuum-filtered through glass fiber. Concurrently, an additional 5 g of each sample were fumigated with 2 mL of ethanol-free chloroform for 24 hours, vented for one hour and then extracted as above to determine microbial biomass C and N pools. All extracts were frozen at -20 ?C until analysis.  
Dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen in the K2SO4 extracts and the fumigated soil K2SO4 extracts were quantified using the non-purgable-organic-C protocol on a total organic carbon analyzer equipped with a total dissolved nitrogen module (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Columbia, MD, U.S.A.). Soil microbial biomass C and N were estimated by subtracting concentrations of DOC and DON in the unfumigated samples as well as soil free controls from the fumigated samples.  Dissolved inorganic N and P in the K2SO4 extracts was analyzed spectrophotometrically on a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Inc., Winooski, VT, U.S.A.) using vanadium chloride/sulfanilamide reduction chemistry and colormetric determination of nitrite for nitrate, ammonium using a modified Berlethot reaction and dissolved inorganic phosphorus by the malachite green colorimetric procedure.
In addition to biogeochemical pools,  pH, bulk density, and texture were assessed, using a digital pH meter (Oakton instruments, Vernon Hills, IL, U.S.A.), a standard soil corer with a known radius, and texture in g L-1 was determined in-house and by the Soil, Water and Plant Testing Laboratory at Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO U.S.A.) using a hydrometer, respectively.
