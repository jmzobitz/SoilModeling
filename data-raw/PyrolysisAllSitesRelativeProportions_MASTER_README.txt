Date of data collection (can be a single date, or a range) 
Soils collected Summer 2013 (see MONTH DAY YEAR fields). 
NOTE that the dates for sampling are 1 day AFTER the dates for efflux measurements.
NOTE that Dave Moore CHANGED the date for SPR sampling in this file because it was incorrectly listed as 8/26 - the corrected date (8/23) has been added. 2/27/2014
NOTE there was ONLY ONE COLLECTION DATE for SPR and LSP and 2 collection dates for UMC.
