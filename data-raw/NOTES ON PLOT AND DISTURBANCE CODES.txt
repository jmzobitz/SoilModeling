Project NSF RAPID | High Park ecosystem function post beetle and fire disturbance. 

I have defined the codes for beetle kill or not and visual fire severity categories as follows:
VisualFireSeverity='Visual Estimates of burn intensity Trahan/Dynes| UNBUR: Unburned, LIGHT: Light Burn, MOD: Moderate Burn, SEVER: Severe Burn';
Fire_CODE='Coded Visual Estimates of burn intensity Trahan/Dynes| 0: Unburned, 1: Light Burn, 2: Moderate Burn, 3: Severe Burn';

BarkBeetle='Evidence of Bark Beetle Damage (tree rings and field estimates Trahan/Dynes)| YES: Evidence present, NO: Evidence Absent';
Beetle_CODE='Coded Evidence of Bark Beetle Damage (tree rings and field estimates Trahan/Dynes)| 1: Evidence present, 0: Evidence Absent';

I have created a THREE CHARACTER CODE for the plot numbers (it must be a three character code in char$/string format)
PlotCODE_ID='Three Letter code for within site identification';

***NICOLE FYI 
To harmonize the plot numbers (from number format) you can use the following code to create the ‘plotCODE_ID’ from numeric values from 1 to 118
When we merge these files with the laboratory data we will merge by Site and by plotCODE_ID’ based on plot level summaries. 

plotCODE = plot + 1000;
Junk1 = put(plotCODE, 4.) ; 
PlotCODE_ID = substr(Junk1, 2, 3);
drop Junk1 plotCODE;

Within each plot there are 4 soil efflux collars indicated by the variable QUADRANT. In Niwot/Fraser we went with N,S,E,W – in High Park we went with NE,NW,SE,SW. To harmonize these codes I’ve made them uppercase TWO LETTER codes by adding the letter Q to the Niwot/Fraser codes. 

QUADRANT='Quadrant of plot/location where the soil collar was placed| FEF & NWT collars are arranged on cardinal axes North, South, East or West | All High Park location have collars arranged on intercardinal axes';

Thus the plots can be identified uniquely by site, plot and disturbance category, by adding the codes for beetles and fire as follows:

PLOTID='Unique identifier for each plot| combination of site||PlotCODE_ID||Beetle_CODE||Fire_CODE';

For example
LSP02200
Lory State Park, plot 022, no beetle kill, unburned

SPR04111
Stove Prairie Ranch, plot 041, beetle killed, light burn
