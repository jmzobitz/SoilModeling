ACTIVITIES of different enzymes at 4, 15, 25 and 35 degrees

UNITS - unit: nmol activity/g dry soil/h

BG - b-1,4-Glucosidase
 Catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal 1,4-linked b-D-glucose
residues from b-D-glucosides, including short-chain
cellulose oligomers, especially cellobiose

CB - b-D-1,4-Cellobiosidase
Catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,4-b- D-glucosidic linkages in
cellulose and cellotetraose, releasing cellobiose from the
nonreducing ends of the chains

NAG - b-1,4-N-Acetylglucosaminidase
Catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal 1,4-linked N-acetylbeta-D-glucosaminide
residues in chitooligosaccharides
(chitin-derived oligomers)

PHOS - Acid phosphatase
Mineralizes organic P into phosphate by hydrolyzing
phosphoric (mono) ester bonds under acidic conditions

XYL - b-1,4-Xylosidase
Degrades xylooligomers (short xylan chains) into xylose.
Xylans are b-1,4-linked polymers of xylopyranose––a
plant structural polymer less tightly associated with plant
cell walls than cellulose

AG - a-1,4-Glucosidase
Principally a starch-degrading enzyme; catalyzes the
hydrolysis of terminal, nonreducing 1,4-linked a-Dglucose
residues, releasing a-D-glucose

LAP - Leucine amino peptidase
Catalyzes the hydrolysis of leucine and other amino acid
residues from the N-terminus of peptides; most reactive
towards leucine. Amino acid amides and methyl esters
are also readily hydrolyzed by this enzyme, which has
broad specificity
